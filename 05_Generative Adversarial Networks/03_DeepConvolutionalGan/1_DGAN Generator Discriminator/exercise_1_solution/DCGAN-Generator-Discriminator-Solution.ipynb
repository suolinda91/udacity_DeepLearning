    "# Deep Convolutional GANs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll build a GAN using convolutional layers in the generator and discriminator. This is called a Deep Convolutional GAN, or DCGAN for short. The DCGAN architecture was first explored in 2016 and has seen impressive results in generating new images; you can read the [original paper, here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll be training DCGAN on the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. These are color images of different classes, such as airplanes, dogs or trucks. This dataset is much more complex and diverse than the MNIST dataset and justifies the use of the DCGAN architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../assets/cifar10_data.png' width=80% />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our goal is to create a DCGAN that can generate new, realistic-looking images. We'll go through the following steps to do this:\n",
    "* Load in and pre-process the CIFAR10 dataset\n",
    "* **Define discriminator and generator networks**\n",
    "* Train these adversarial networks\n",
    "* Visualize the loss over time and some sample, generated images\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on defining the networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deeper Convolutional Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this dataset is more complex than our MNIST data, we'll need a deeper network to accurately identify patterns in these images and be able to generate new ones. Specifically, we'll use a series of convolutional or transpose convolutional layers in the discriminator and generator. It's also necessary to use batch normalization to get these convolutional networks to train. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these changes in network structure, training the discriminator and generator networks should be the same as before. That is, the discriminator will alternate training on real and fake (generated) images, and the generator will aim to trick the discriminator into thinking that its generated images are real!"

    "* The inputs to the discriminator are 32x32x3 tensor images\n",
    "* You'll want a few convolutional, hidden layers\n",
    "* Then a fully connected layer for the output; as before, we want a sigmoid output, but we'll add that in the loss function, [BCEWithLogitsLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#bcewithlogitsloss), later\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll also want to use batch normalization with [nn.BatchNorm2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#batchnorm2d) on each layer **except** the first convolutional layer and final, linear output layer. \n",

    "#### Helper `ConvBlock` module \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, each layer should look something like convolution > batch norm > leaky ReLU, and so we'll define a **custom torch Module** to put these layers together. This module will create a sequential series of a convolutional + an optional batch norm layer. \n",
