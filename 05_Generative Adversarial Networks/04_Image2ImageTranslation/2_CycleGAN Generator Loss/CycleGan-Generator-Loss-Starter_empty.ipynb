Specifically, we'll look at a set of images of [Yosemite national park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) taken either during the summer of winter. The seasons are our two domains!\n",

A CycleGAN is designed for image-to-image translation and it learns from unpaired training data. This means that in order to train a generator to translate images from domain $X$ to domain $Y$, we do not have to have exact correspondences between individual images in those domains. For example, in [the paper that introduced CycleGANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593), the authors are able to translate between images of horses and zebras, even though there are no images of a zebra in exactly the same position as a horse or with exactly the same background, etc. Thus, CycleGANs enable learning a mapping from one domain $X$ to another domain $Y$ without having to find perfectly-matched, training pairs!\n",

Deeper networks are more likely to have vanishing or exploding gradients and, therefore, have trouble reaching convergence; batch normalization helps with this a bit. However, during training, we often see that deep networks respond with a kind of training degradation. Essentially, the training accuracy stops improving and gets saturated at some point during training. In the worst cases, deep models would see their training accuracy actually worsen over time!\n",
